# HTML-Email-example
This is an example of a html email that can be sent via PHP. I used an html e-mail template from ColorlibHQ/email-templates's repository.
# Important
I deleted almost every part of the style tag that the template had and put some of those properties into the elements themselves. This way they would maintain the style when sended through a php script. Otherwise the styles would be errased.
